## Minimum Design Criteria

Since you have completed a lot of UI and UX tasks already, you must have gotten a fair idea of what comprises a good UI and what doesn't look good. Being a 30 pointer you have to yourself decide what looks good enough to get merged and what doesn't. Final decision resides with mentors and organisers same as all the previous task. 😊
