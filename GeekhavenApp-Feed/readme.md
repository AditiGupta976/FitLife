## Submission Guideline:

       (Like the one in instagram ).

- It should show also display ongoing projects of the users.🧑‍💻
- The content of the screens can vary as per your understanding of the purpose of the app.
- You can take inspiration from the **tumblr app.**
- The screens must have proper consistency in terms of fonts colours and imagery
- Submit the link to the figma file in a .txt file and place the file in ‘GeekhavenApp-Feed**’** only.

## Minimum Design Criteria

Since you have completed a lot of UI and UX tasks already, you must have gotten a fair idea of what comprises a good UI and what doesn't look good. Being a 20 pointer you have to yourself decide what looks good enough to get merged and what doesn't. Final decision resides with mentors and organisers same as all the previous task. 😊
