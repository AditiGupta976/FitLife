## Submission Guideline:

- Design wireframes for FitLife💪 app based on your understanding of the app from the given user flow : (best userflow from UX Task-1)
  - https://www.figma.com/file/i7fDfh9DLE42qNoiBvEXn0/Untitled?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=RPPVSEv73rCXIJUN-1 ( **Special thanks to @AditiGupta976** for contributing this great user flow in the first task)
- The Wireframe design should go with the userflow provided.
- Submit the Figma file link in a .txt folder and submit the file in UX Task - 2 folder ONLY.

## Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)

Since it is a **20 point task**, do read and fulfil the MDC accordingly.

- Design the Wireframes for **atleast 4** screens of the app including all the necessary functions of the app.✅
- Your design should have a consistent theme across all of the screens.
- You can take inspiration from the internet and implement it using your own perspective and approach.

**NOTE:** Strict plagarism is applied so **Do not COPY PASTE** other’s idea. Copying and submitting other’s idea just for points is useless. The motive of Opencode is to learn and not to copy.😊

If some of these things appear complex to you, don't worry too much 😅. Since creating wireframes is a form of art in and of itself, beginners may find the process intimidating. You can ping us on discord in the FitLife**💪** channel and we will be happy to help you with your queries.

Keep Learning! 🚀
